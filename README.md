Food Order & Delivery Website - MERN Stack

A full-stack web application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack for food ordering and delivery. The app allows users to:

Authentication: Users can register, log in, and manage their accounts securely.
Order Food: Browse through a wide selection of food items, add them to the cart, and place orders.
Cart Management: View, modify, and manage items in the cart before checkout.
Order History: Users can view their past orders and track order statuses.
Admin Features: Admins can add/edit food items, manage orders, and monitor user activity.
MongoDB Atlas Integration: The app uses MongoDB Atlas for scalable and secure cloud database storage.
This project demonstrates how to implement user authentication, dynamic cart management, and efficient database handling using the MERN stack. It offers a seamless food ordering experience and serves as a solid foundation for further expansion.
